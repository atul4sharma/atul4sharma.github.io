## TODO  

- [ ] Modify blog UI
    - [X] Add **TIL**(Today I learned) format to the blog
    - [X] Change the theme of the blog 
    - [X] Change the font
    - [ ] Change the highlighting. Markdown highlighting is not very intuitive.
    - [ ] tags are only evaluated for _posts directory. Make it parse all tags OR move _til post to _posts and still show the TIL posts on it's page
