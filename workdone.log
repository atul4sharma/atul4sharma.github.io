    Removes the removeImage() from ImageTimeModel and ImageLocationModel
    
    Summary: * Since there is KDirWatch which will notice the change in the directory, we don't need to specify specific removeImage function for ImageTimemodel and ImageLocationModel to remove image from the database, instead we can just call KIO::trash() and the signal handler (reindexSubFolder in FileSystemTracker) for KDirWatch automatically updates the database.

    Summary:
    * Adds KDirWatch
    * When files in watched directory is changed, FileSystemTracker again scans the changed directory to update the database,
    * When database is updated ImageStorage::instance() emits storageModified signal which then allows the ImageLocationModel, ImageTimeModel to update themselves
