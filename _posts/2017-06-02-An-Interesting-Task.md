### Yesterday was interesting.
This task 
    - [T6231](https://phabricator.kde.org/T6231).
<p>Previous code had different qml files ( Folders.qml, Locations.qml, TimeImages.qml). The new code allows to have a single qml file for every model available in the Koko codebase instead of having different qml files for every single model. It changes the model in the view according to the filter selected.</p>
