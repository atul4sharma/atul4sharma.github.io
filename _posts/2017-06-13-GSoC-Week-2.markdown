### Week 2 was just about minor changes
* Change the delegate for the AlbumView
    - A better delegate FocusScope which is composed of Image and Kirigami's BasicListItem for showing label.
* Changes type of previouslySelectedAction from string to Kirigami.Action.
    - No use of findAction function now
* Made sidebar actions look selected when the corresponding view is loaded
* Removes handleVisible property for the GlobalDrawer
    - Handle property is something that should be dependent on the default style used by the environment
* Implementation of ImageViewer has started
