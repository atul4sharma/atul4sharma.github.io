## Every Summer has it's story.
### Mine is Google Summer Of Code this year :)
* My proposal "[Mirgating to Kirigami](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5268432239984640)" for the "[Koko](https://cgit.kde.org/koko.git/)" image gallery application of KDE organisation has been selected this year.
* Mostly my work will be to port the QtQuick elements to the [Kirigami](https://techbase.kde.org/Kirigami).
* I will be working under the guidance of [Marco Martin](http://notmart.org/blog/) and [Bhushan Shah](http://blog.bshah.in/) as my mentors.
