## Every Summer has it's story.
### Mine is Google Summer Of Code this year :)
* My proposal "[Mirgating to Kirigami](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8r16OE2JSpsaGtOTzc5aHZtVkU)" for the "[Koko](https://cgit.kde.org/koko.git/)" image gallery application of KDE organisation has been selected this year.
* Mostly my work will be to port the QtQuick elements to the Kirigami.
* I will be working under the guidance of [Marco Martin](http://notmart.org/blog/) and [Bhushan Shah](http://blog.bshah.in/) as my mentors.
