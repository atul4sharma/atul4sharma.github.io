## Every Summer has it's story.
### Mine is Google Summer Of Code this year :)
* My proposal "Mirgating to Kirigami" for the "Koko" image gallery application of KDE organisation has been selected this year.
* Mostly my work will be to port the QtQuick elements to the Kirigami.
* I will be working under the guidance of [Marco Martin]() and [Bhushan Shah]() as my mentors.
