#So far, porting to Kirigami elements has started
* Sidebar is connected to mainview now( model in the mainview now changes according to filter selected from the Sidebar)
* AlbumView has just about the basic structure in terms of display delegates.
* On clicking the collection in AlbumView page now redirects to OverviewPage, that shows image of particular collection( according to the filter selected)
