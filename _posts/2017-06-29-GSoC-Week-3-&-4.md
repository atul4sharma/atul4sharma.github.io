### Quite a few changes were introduced during this time period
* Keyboard navigation was fixed for the GridView of AlbumView and OverviewPage.
    - The GridView was not getting focusScope because of the Kirigami's ScrollablePage, which was corrected by [Marco Martin](http://notmart.org/blog/) in the Kirigami repository.
<br><br>
* Introduced corner action for selection of collections and images same as that in Dolphin file manager.<br><br>
    - Selecting a collection (before clicked)
    ![Selecting a collection before clicked](/img/selection-before-clicked.png)
    <br><br>
    - Selecting a collection (after clicked)
    ![Selecting a collection after clicked](/img/selection-after-clicked.png)
    <br><br>
* Made visibilty of the selectionHighlight dependent on the selection of the collections.
    - As soon as a collection is clicked, the index is inserted into the m_selectionModel (SortModel).
    - And the visibilty status of the selectionHighlight is dependent on whether the index is selected or not in the m_selectionModel
    <br><br>
* Completely removed Baloo from the application as it was not very useful according to the application requirements.
    <br><br>
* The implementation of ImageFolderModel is changed a little bit. 
    - Now the ImageFolderModel's implementation is based on KIO framework.
    <br><br>
* A new model ImageListModel is created to store just the list of images. That is each row of the model will be a single image.
